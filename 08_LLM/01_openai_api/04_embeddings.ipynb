One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!<br />However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.<br /><br />If you want a really good egg-free \\\"custard\\\" get an original recipe for \\\"blanc mange.\\\"  It takes a lot longer to

One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!&lt;br /&gt;However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a really good egg-free \"custard\" get an original recipe for \"blanc mange.\"  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference.</th>\n","      <td>[0.005564768798649311, -0.012970144860446453, ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.

After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.<br /><br />So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!  I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale was <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C9QEVU\\\">Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> (excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup was <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I3I4\\\">Green Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a> (also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's \\\"Big Easy Bold\\\").<br /><br />For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one. If you're like me you won't be disappointed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embedding\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","cos_sim = lambda a, b: np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b)) # 코사인 유사도\n","\n","def get_similar_texts(query, embed_df, top_n=5):\n","  query_embed = texts_to_embedding(query)[0]\n","  embed_df['cos_sim'] = embed_df['embedding'].apply(lambda x:cos_sim(x, query_embed))\n","  return embed_df.sort_values('cos_sim', ascending=False).head(top_n)"],"metadata":{"id":"x2nmbl8UHcrT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744849869910,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"JS B","userId":"14406863337187805558"}}},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["get_similar_texts(['coffee'], embed_df)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":359},"id":"5F-9e6UAKBs6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744849948265,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":932,"user":{"displayName":"JS B","userId":"14406863337187805558"}},"outputId":"49c57ebb-d886-447f-d03c-ca93b3ea23c3"},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                                                            embedding  \\\n","Text                                                                                                    \n","I I haven't had a bad cup of coffee yet.
